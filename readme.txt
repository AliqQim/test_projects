parent - EF_Core__ConfigurationAndMigrations__v3

I was trying to find a way to mock DbContext so that e.g. ToListAsync could be used like ToList is used in conjunction with List.AsQueryable

but I've tried couple of advices from the internet and gave up this Idea

I guess in-memory-DB tests should be used in such cases
